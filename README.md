# Blood-Group-Prediction-using-ML
A person's blood group can be predicted manually using their parents' blood group. Through this project we have tried to do that using Machine Learning.
Since, the data we had was small and not very diverse, the accuracy is a bit low. It could be improved a lot by usimg a huge dataset.
